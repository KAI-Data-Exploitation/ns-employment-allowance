<h1 id="introduction">1 Introduction</h1>
<p><b>Employment Allowance take-up statistics</b></p>
<p>This release covers take-up of the Employment Allowance (EA) for the full tax year 2016-17. The EA came into effect in April 2014 and provided eligible employers with a reduction of up to £2,000 in their National Insurance contributions (NICs) which they pay on their employees. In April 2016, the allowance rose to £3,000. The allowance is available to business, charities, amateur sports clubs and, from April 2015, domestic employers of care and support workers.</p>
<p>However, from April 2016 limited companies where the director is the only employee paid earnings above the Secondary Threshold for Class 1 National Insurance contributions have no longer been able to claim the allowance. As expected this policy change has led to an overall decrease in the numbers taking up the EA in 2016-17 from 2015-16 with take-up decreasing by around 120,000 (9%). This has decreased take-up of the allowance across regions, sectors, constituencies and small employers where there are concentrations of companies affected by this measure. Other domestic employers and public sector employers whose work is wholly or partly (&gt;50%) of a public nature are not eligible for the allowance.</p>
<p>The EA can be claimed through an employer’s payroll system which is then processed through HMRC’s Real Time Information (RTI) systems. An employer can claim their eligibility for the allowance by submitting an Employer Payment Summary (EPS). When an employer then sends through their Full Payment Submissions (FPS) when submitting their payroll the EA is offset against their Class 1 secondary NICs liabilities due on their employee(s). An employer must generate a NICs liability to benefit from the allowance. The amount of Class 1 secondary NICs due for payment can be reduced by a maximum of £3,000 in a given tax year.</p>
<p>In this release, employers are classified as having taken up the EA if they have both claimed eligibility and had some amount of the EA offset against the amount of Class 1 secondary NICs which they pay to HMRC.</p>

<li><p>Counts for the number of employers who have taken up the Employment Allowance (EA) come from the PAYE accounting system (the Enterprise Tax Management Platform - ETMP) linked to the Real Time Information (RTI).</p></li>
<li><p>A PAYE scheme will be counted if they have both claimed the EA and have offset some amount of the EA against their Class 1 secondary NICs liabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Postcode information, which is used to present region and constituency level breakdowns, has been taken from the Office for National Statistics’ Inter-departmental Business Registry (IDBR). The IDBR to the ETMP produced a match rate of 93% for postcode information. The postcode used corresponds to the PAYE scheme which is claiming the EA.</p></li>
<li><p>Sector information also comes from the IDBR based on the Standard Industry Classification (SIC) 2007. At 93%, the match rate for sector is similar to that of postcode.</p></li>
<li><p>Employee size information comes from RTI and is a measure of employee count corresponding to the PAYE scheme which is claiming the EA. The match rate is close to 100%.</p></li>
